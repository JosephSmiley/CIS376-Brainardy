When the user selects "Play Game" from home screen...

It will go to the category selection screen.
The user will select five categories from the dropdown. This will be done one at a time.
The user can confirm his or her choice of categories by clicking on the "Confirm" button.
The game cannot start with less than or greater than five categories. Once five categories are selected, the game will begin

The screen transitions from the category selection screen to the question and answer screen, where the user will be provided questions from their choice of categories in no particular order.
The user will fill in the answer fields with their responses. The answers are case-sensitive and must match the fields saved in the database in order for the points to be earned.
When the user is ready with their answers, the user can select the "Submit" button at the bottom of the page.
The answers are then compared with the database answers character-by-character and either returns a correct or incorrect response.
The score will be calculated from the number of correct answers out of the total number of questions. 
The score will be displayed on the screen upon calculation on a new screen (we'll call it the evaluation screen).
The user can look at their responses and see how they align with the correct answers.

The user can either play the game again (it will go back to the category selection screen) or return to the home screen.

**I was only able to get the dropdown to work in the category selection screen but nothing else beyond that.**
**Hashem and Ahmed haven't done anything with the code, yet I was able to put in some effort into the game functionality (while understanding a bit about how the Kotlin language works).**
